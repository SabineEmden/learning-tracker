# 100 Days of Code - February 2026

My goal for this 100-Days-of-Code challenge is to build projects and gain coding practice by solving challenges provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). This is in addition to working through the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) to learn full-stack JavaScript web development.

## Day 0: Sunday, February 1, 2026

**I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.**

- I will push code to GitHub every day so anyone can see my progress.
- I wil update this learning log with the day's progress and a link the project I worked on.
- I will work on projects that mirror real-world development work.
- Time spend on tutorials, online courses, and similar resources&mdash;including articles in the Frontend Mentor learning paths and lessons in The Odin Project&mdash;will NOT count towards this challenge.

## Day 1: Monday, February 2, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Set up GitHub repository and deployed project on GitHub Pages.
- Structured content with HTML, added icons and links.
- Set up CSS stylesheet, added CSS reset and CSS variables for colors.
- Next is typography.

## Day 2: Tuesday, February 3, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Downloaded font files from Google Fonts.
- Subset fonts to Basic Latin and converted files from TTF to WOFF2.
- Added font files to the project.

This took much longer than I had planned. I had taken a deep dive into web sustainability best practices for typography for my Frontend Mentor [QR code component solution](https://github.com/SabineEmden/qr-code-component) but needed a refresher. Fortunately, I found all the information I needed in the READMEs for my previous projects.

## Day 3: Wednesday, February 4, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Added font-face declarations.
- Centered card component on page.
- Styled attribution in page footer.
- Styled card component for mobile view.
- Next is styling buttons.

## Day 4: Thursday, February 5, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Styled buttons in default and hover states.
- Added rounded corners to card.
- Added tablet and desktop designs with breakpoints.
- Next are HTML validation and accessibility testing.

## Day 5: Friday, February 6, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Added flexbox to card sections to align buttons.
- Tested larger browser font sizes and zoom for web accessibility.
- Checked HTML code with HTML validator.
- Wrote custom README.
- Next is submitting my solution on the Frontend Mentor platform.

## Day 6: Saturday, February 7, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Submitted solution to Frontend Mentor.
- Fixed issues flagged in accessibility report, HTML report, and CSS report.

Frontend Mentor provides [AI-enhanced solution reports](https://www.frontendmentor.io/articles/guaranteed-solution-insights-with-ai-enhanced-reports) to PRO subscribers. This was my first time working with these reports. I found them very helpful. They caught a number of issues in my code, and flagged a few more that I dismissed.

## Day 7: Sunday, February 8, 2026

I worked on [Single price grid component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-single-price-grid-component).

- Started the challenge and downloaded starter files.
- Set up GitHub repository and deployed project on GitHub Pages.
- Structured content with HTML.

## Day 8: Monday, February 9, 2026

I worked on [3-column preview card component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-3-column-preview-card-component).

- Wrote code review for a solution submitted by another Frontend Mentor community member.

Reading and reviewing code written by other developers is an important skill. But I'm still undecided whether I want to count the time I spent writing code reviews towards this challenge. Writin code reviews is more a communications skills than a coding skill.

I also worked on [Single price grid component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-single-price-grid-component).

- Set up CSS style sheet, added CSS reset and custom properties for colors.
- - Downloaded font files from Google Fonts.
- Subset fonts to Basic Latin and converted files from TTF to WOFF2.
- Added font files to the project.
- Added font-face declarations and typographic styles.

## Day 9: Tuesday, February 10, 2026

I worked on [Single price grid component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-single-price-grid-component).

- Center component on page
- Style grid container for mobile layout
- Add padding and margins to grid sections and content

This is a weird design. I don't agree with some of the choices the designer made. For example, the color contrasts don't meet the web accessibility standards.

## Day 10: Wednesday, February 11, 2026

I worked on [Single price grid component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-single-price-grid-component).

- Added hover style to button
- Added CSS grid for mobile and desktop layouts
- Added visually hidden <h1> heading to page
- Styled attribution in page footer
- Tested browser zoom and large browser font size
- Next is writing custom README

## Day 11: Thursday, February 12, 2026

I worked on [Single price grid component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-single-price-grid-component).

- Reviewed my code
- Wrote custom README
- Submitted my solution to Frontend Mentor
- Worked through several rounds of AI-enhanced solution reports.

The accessibility reports took issue with the placeholder link and make several recommendations to improve its accessibility. Consecutive reports contradicted each other on whether the link should be focusable by keyboard or not. I felt like I was running in circles and need some non-AI feedback on this issue. I plan to post it on the Frontend Mentor Discord server tomorrow.

## Day 12: Friday, February 13, 2026

I worked on [Single price grid component](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-single-price-grid-component).

- Asked on the Frontend Mentor Discord server for help with the recommendations in the accessibility report regarding the link.
- Learned my initial solution was correct, and I can disregard the issue.
- Changed my code back to my initial solution and generated new reports.

The accessibility report now says "No accessibility issues found". There are still two HTML and ten CSS issues. But I know for all of them why I'm disregarding them. The only weird thing now is that the CSS report recommends I change a line of code that is not even in my solution.

I started the [order summary card](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-order-summary-component) challenge.

- Downloaded starter files.
- Set up GitHub repository and deployed project on GitHub Pages.

## Day 13: Saturday, February 14, 2026

I worked on the [order summary card](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-order-summary-component) challenge.

- Read article [A Web Developer's Guide to Buttons vs Links](https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/button-vs-link/) by A11Y Collective.
- Looked through Figma design file to plan my approach.
- Structured content with HTML.
- Added images to component.
- Added CSS style sheet.

## Day 14: Sunday, February 15, 2025

I worked on the [order summary card](https://github.com/SabineEmden/fm-order-summary-component) challenge.

- Added Josh Comeau's CSS Reset.
- Declared CSS custom properties for colors, typography, and spacing.
