# 100 Days of Code - JavaScript Edition

My goal for this 100 Days of Code Challenge is to finish the [JavaScript Course](https://www.findingsteadyground.com/) on the [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) learning path of The Odin Project. The course has 31 lessons and 12 projects.

## Day 1: Monday, February 10, 2025

It's been more than three months since I last worked with JavaScript. I started with a quick refresher on the syntax. [Learn JavaScript in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/javascript/) is a good reference.

## Day 2: Tuesday, February 11,

I'm reviewing JavaScript objects before I dive into object constructors and prototypal inheritance. I'm happy to report I did not forget everything I learnt a couple of months ago.

I started the [Getting Job Ready](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/getting-job-ready-D1Oy0wCxWj) learning path on Frontend Mentor and worked on optimizing my GitHub profile. I made some improvements to my GitHub profile README. The README files in my GitHub repositories were already in good shape thanks to the README template that comes with all Frontend Mentor challenges.

## Day 3: Wednesday, February 12, 2025

Today's topics in my JavaScript course were object constructors, prototypes, and inheritance. It's a bit confusing. I hope it gets clearer once I start working with it, not just reading about it.

## Day 4: Thursday, February 13, 2025

I started the first project for my JavaScript course. [Project: Library](https://github.com/SabineEmden/odin-library) a small library app. Users can see the books in the library, add and remove books, and toggle the status of a book between "not read yet" and "read".

## Day 5: Friday, February 14, 2025

My JavaScript review earlier this week didn't include DOM manipulation and events. I made up for that today.

I also added code to my library project to display books on the page. So far it's only an unordered list. My goal is to have a card for each book with a button to delete the book from the library and another button to toggle between "not read yet" and "read". I'll also need a form to add new books to the library.

## Day 6: Saturday, February 15, 2025

I decided to take a break from my JavaScript course on weekends and read [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) by Marijn Haverbeke instead. I started with Part 2: Browser.

## Day 7: Sunday, February 16, 2025

I read more Eloquent JavaScript today.

It would have been a better choice if I had taken a rest day today, along with some time for a weekly review. Trying to do a 100-day challenge without any rest days is not a good idea. I tried that before, and it didn't go well.

## Day 8: Monday, February 17, 2025

I did today what I should have done yesterday:

I took a break from learning JavaScript, reflected on the past week, planned for the current week, and took a long walk to get some fresh air and sunshine before the next winter storm comes rolling in.

## Day 9: Tuesday, February 18, 2025

I started the lesson on creating an effective portfolio on the Getting Job Ready learning path by Frontend Mentor. Not that I'll be job ready any time soon, but there are some steps that I like to start early, while I'm still working on building my technical skills. I already have a [personal website](https://www.sabineemden.com/) that I built with a [blogging template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/blog). I could turn it into a portfolio site, or I could start from scratch with a [portfolio template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/portfolio).

## Day 10: Wednesday, February 19, 2025

I had a complete lack of motivation for coding today, so I picked the project I was most excited about: planning how to transform my personal website from a blog to a portfolio website.

## Day 11: Thursday, February 20, 2025

I finally got my learning tracker up to date, both the weekly reviews and the daily progress logs for my 100 Days of Code challenge.

I updated the README files of seven GitHub repositories by using image compression for the screenshots. I was already in the habit of optimizing font files, and the screenshot images were often the biggest files in my projects.

I even picked up my library project again and worked on the JavaScript code for displaying the books on the page.

# Day 12: Friday, February 21, 2025

Today wasn't quite as productive as yesterday, although I did make some progress on the library project for my JavaScript course. I moved the code for displaying the books on the page into functions (with each function only doing one specific thing), and I chose a design inspiration for colors and fonts.

# Day 13: Saturday, February 22, 2025

I decided to take the weekends off from learning JavaScript. I went to a yoga class, did some laundry, caught up with family members in Germany, and baked cookies.

# Day 14: Sunday, February 23, 2025

I didn't manage to reflect on the past week or plan for the coming week today.

# Day 15: Monday, February 24, 2025

I had a lot going on today, none of it was related to web development. I finally got my mail-in ballot for the German federal election. Unfortunately, election day was yesterday, and I didn't have a chance to vote.

# Day 16: Tuesday, February 25, 2025

I didn't sleep well last night and feel very tired.
