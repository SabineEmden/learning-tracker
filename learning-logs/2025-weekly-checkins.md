# Weekly Check-ins 2025

## Week 1: December 30, 2024 through January 5, 2025

### Recap

This was the second and final week I took time off from learning web development to celebrate Christmas and the New Year, to reflect on 2024 and to plan for 2025.

### Highs

I revived my learning tracker on GitHub. It's a relict from one of my earlier attempts at learning web development and my repo with the most stars (or I would have already deleted it). One of my New Year's resolutions is to post weekly check-in on the Discord Server of The Odin Project. The learning tracker give me a place to keep a public record of these check-ins.

### Lows

I felt a lot of resistance again filling out the template for my end-of-year reflection for 2024. I will have to take some more time to make peace with the past year.

### Shout-outs

**Matthias Ott** and his newsletter [Own Your Web - Issue 17: Jump Start](https://buttondown.com/ownyourweb/archive/issue-17/) inspired my to revive my learning tracker.

I used [Jahresreflexion 2024](https://einguterplan.de/jahresreflexion/) (in German) by **Jan Lenarz** for Ein guter Verlag for my end-of-year annual reflection.

## Week 2: January 6, 2025 through January 12, 2025

### Recap

I did not go back to coding and learning web development yet but took some time to focus on my mindfulness practice. And I finished my end-of-year reflection for 2024.

On Friday evening, we got measurable amounts of snow in central North Carolina for the first time in almost three years.

### Highs

I was able to fight off a respiratory virus and didn't get any cold symptoms.

### Lows

I had to cancel all my plans for the weekend, on Saturday due to weather, on Sunday because I didn't want to risk spreading the virus I was fighting off.

### Shout-outs

I'm grateful for [seasonal flu vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/keyfacts.html). Me getting my flu shot last fall could be a major reason why I didn't get sick this week.

## Week 3: January 13, 2025 through January 19, 2025

### Recap

I resumed my work on [Project: Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/SabineEmden/odin-admin-dashboard) for The Odin Project. It's almost finished. All I have left to do are some updates to the README.

I had oral surgery on Tuesday to get a tooth pulled.

### Highs

Over the course of my work on the Admin Dashboard, I spent a lot of time on the SVG icons, making them interactive and accessible. I'm pleased with the results.

### Lows

I got a sore throat on Saturday and had to cancel all my plans for the weekend again.

### Shout-outs

My dentist's office has a eclectic list of foods to eat after dental surgery. Among other things, they recommend crème brûlée, key lime pie, cheesecake, clams, and egg nog.
