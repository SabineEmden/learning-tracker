# Weekly Check-ins

## Week 1: December 30, 2024 through January 5, 2025

### Recap

This was the second and final week I took time off from learning web development to celebrate Christmas and the New Year, to reflect on 2024 and to plan for 2025.

### Highs

I revived my learning tracker on GitHub. It's a relict from one of my earlier attempts at learning web development and my repo with the most stars (or I would have already deleted it). One of my New Year's resolutions is to post weekly check-in on the Discord Server of The Odin Project. The learning tracker give me a place to keep a public record of these check-ins.

### Lows

I felt a lot of resistance again filling out the template for my end-of-year reflection for 2024. I will have to take some more time to make peace with the past year.

### Shout-outs

**Matthias Ott** and his newsletter [Own Your Web - Issue 17: Jump Start](https://buttondown.com/ownyourweb/archive/issue-17/) inspired my to revive my learning tracker.

I used [Jahresreflexion 2024](https://einguterplan.de/jahresreflexion/) (in German) by **Jan Lenarz** for Ein guter Verlag for my end-of-year annual reflection.
