100DaysOfCode R1D4

I added the finishing touches to my portfolio site. I had to replace the screen shot of the site in the Projects section after I changed the background color for the body element. At first, the new image didn't show up on the deployed site. It turned out all I had to do was to wait (I guess for the host server to update its files). The problem resolved itself while I make dough for Christmas cookies. Sometimes stepping away from your computer can be the best thing you can do.

I finally added this monthly log for December to my learning tracker. Today is **not** the first day I have been coding this month.
