## Daily Log

### Monday, November 12, 2018

I started the Web Design for Everybody Capstone course today and completed most of the work for Week 1. 

Week 1 covers the requirements for the portfolio website and the options to code from scratch, modify a template, or use a framework. I chose the framework option and plan to use Bootstrap 4. The site will be a personal web development portfolio.

There is an optional peer-graded assignment to submit a short video introducting yourself. I will introduce myself in the discussion forum instead.

I will spend time tomorrow planning the content and the design for the site. The wireframes are due next week.

I read a series of 3 articles on website planning in Smashing Magazine:
[A Comprehensive Website Planning Guide (Part 1)]https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-website-planning-guide-part1/)
[A Comprehensive Website Planning Guide (Part 2)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-website-planning-guide-part2/)
[A Comprehensive Website Planning Guide (Part 3)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/comprehensive-website-planning-guide-part3/)

The articles reminded me that professional website development is a team effort. One person doesn't do marketing, design, and development. I can be a web developer without having to do marketing or design.


### Wednesday, November 14, 2018

I did the optional peer-graded assignment for Week 1 in the Web Desing for Everybody Capstone course. Instead of submitting a video presentation to introduce myself, I introduced myself in the note section for the assignment and posted the link to my learning tracker on GitHub. Of all 16 submission that I reviewed, only three had videos; and only one of the three video submission followed the assignment.

I started working on the wireframes for my portfolio website and found printable wireframe grids for browser and mobile at [Sneakpeekit](http://sneakpeekit.com).


### Thursday, November 15, 2018

I finished the first draft for the wireframes for my portfolio website. 


### Tuesday, November 20, 2018

I submitted the wireframes for my portfolio website for peer review and reviewed one submission from another student.

I completed Week 2 of the Web Design for Everybody Capstone with exception of two additional peer reviews I have to do. I am also still waiting for the reviews of my submission.


### Wednesday, November 21, 2018

I created a GitHub respository for the Web Design for Everybody Capstone, added a very basic index.html file, and deployed the page on GitHub Pages. I also added a README file.
