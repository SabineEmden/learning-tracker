## Daily Log

### Monday, November 12, 2018

I started the Web Design for Everybody Capstone course today and completed most of the work for Week 1. 

Week 1 covers the requirements for the portfolio website and the options to code from scratch, modify a template, or use a framework. I chose the framework option and plan to use Bootstrap 4. The site will be a personal web development portfolio.

There is an optional peer-graded assignment to submit a short video introducting yourself. I will introduce myself in the discussion forum instead.

I will spend time tomorrow planning the content and the design for the site. The wireframes are due next week.
